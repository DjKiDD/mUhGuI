I came up with this idea while using what I assume was either a buggy version of FFDshow or I installed two different versions, I'm really not sure.
It freaked out and sometimes would decode one codec with an "incorrect" one, making a beautiful explosion of pixels or fucked up colorspaces, etc.
I had a realtime glitch on my hands, my body was ready.
The possibilities I realized were almost endless; the combinations of codecs, pixel formats, sample rates, resolutions, etc. I've wasted a good five months searching for more every night lol ;-;
I also got some inspiration from "A Vernacular of File Formats" by Rosa Menkman; specifically her Cinepak "Opened in a VLC player that associated the video with a purple/black/turquoise palette." (Which I have yet to reproduce perfectly)

Originally I would simply use the command line and have to backspace to change parameters, and we all know that is a pain after awhile.
So I made FFMGlitch.bat to speed up the process, which I have integrated into this GUI (Press F7 after tabbing to the console)
I had the GUI idea months ago, but I can't code for shit so I never looked into it. Then I remembered AutoHotKey has a GUI implementation and blindly slapped this together with what little experience I had.


Enough of me, go break some stuff.
So yeh, have fun guis.
