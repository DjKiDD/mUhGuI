Basically were just misinterpreting data in realtime, which I personally consider a "glitch" :p
Anywhore uncompressed formats work the best together, different pixel formats can spice things up, too.
Let your i m a g i n a t i o n run wild.
It's kind of a hit and miss with which formats will work together, but you'll find that out.
Some Codec combinations could actually deafen you, lower your shizzit. Some form glitchy melodies~
I've included a compiled version if you don't have or wan't to install AutoHotKey.

Pls hit me up if you have any ideas or issues! :>


Because I suck, I don't remember the exact combination for the first one, but check it out.

Fuck yeah.

Also included is what is lovingly called "Shitty Webcam".
(SAUCE NOW INCLUDED)
Pretty much it sends a few lines of random data via UDP to your localhost on port 1337; or 127.0.0.1:1337. 
This version starts as soon as it's executed, so I bound some hotkeys to start/kill it. (check halp.txt)
