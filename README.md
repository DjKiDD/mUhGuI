# mUhGuI
A Shitty Command Line and FFMpeg GUI made for 
G L I T C H I N G

Just gonna say right now I can't take full credit. Just an edit of an autohotkey script I found that wraps a blank GUI around Command Prompt. I also can't program for shit :')

Basically were just misinterpreting data, which in my opinion can be a glitch :p
Anywhore uncompressed formats work the best together, different pixel formats can spice things up, too.
Let your i m a g i n a t i o n run wild.


Because I suck, I don't remember the exact combination for this one, but check it out.
