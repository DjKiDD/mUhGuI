# mUhGuI
A Shitty Command Line and FFMpeg GUI made for 
G L I T C H I N G

Just gonna say right now I can't take full credit. Just an edit of an autohotkey script I found that wraps a blank GUI around Command Prompt. I also can't program for shit :')

Basically were just misinterpreting data, which in my opinion can be a glitch :p
Anywhore uncompressed formats work the best together, different pixel formats can spice things up, too.
Let your i m a g i n a t i o n run wild.
It's kind of a hit and miss with which formats will work together, but you'll find that out.


Because I suck, I don't remember the exact combination for the first one, but check it out.

Also included is what is lovingly called "Shitty Webcam".
Right now my mate and I can't find the sauce, I'll update when I do. If you don't wanna use it, then don't. 
Pretty much it sends a few lines of random data via UDP to your localhost on port 1337; or 127.0.0.1:1337. 
This version starts as soon as it's executed, so I bound some hotkeys to start/kill it.
